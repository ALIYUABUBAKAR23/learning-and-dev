Welcome to the **DIGITAL OFFICE APP** created using React, Django, and Django Rest Framework primarily. 

Most of our documentation is neatly organized in a... documentation.
This README file is simply going to show you how to set up the documentation so that setting up this application will be a breeze... hopefully.

# Requirements
- Node.js 14 or greater
- npm or yarn (to install the react application that our documentation runs in)

# Documentation Setup

It is assumed that you are currently in the root directory of this project (which also assumes that you are in a bash terminal or the equivalent on your OS(which also assumes that you know how to open a bash terminal or the equivalent in your OS)).
That is a lot of assumptions but we assume you know these and therefore will be able to follow the instructions from here on out. 

```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm start
``` 
If you are using yarn then you can
```bash
cd docs
yarn
yarn start
``` 

That's it! A browser tab will open automatically and you will see the documentation that shows you how to setup the Digital Office Application.
Happy Developing.
