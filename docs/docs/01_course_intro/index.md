# Django REST APIs, React Interfaces

Hi, and welcome to the **Digital Office** project documentation!

DIGITAL OFFICE is an *Enterprise Resource Planner* built with **Django - Python** and **React - JavaScript** for Right Click Solutions ltd.

In this documentation you can find the complete setup guide and system architecture as well as other useful information about this Web Application. We made this to help developers navigate the application more easily. 

We've found that really helps newbies on the project get up and running without any major hiccup!

This is how we recommend using the documentation:

- Do not skim. READ each page carefully and make sure you understand the instructions.
- Follow each instruction step by step. Skipping a step may lead to tears later.

I promise that if you follow this approach, you will master this project within a few weeks. And you'll soon be able to write clean, intelligable and efficient code that will not crash the production server!

:::tip Note-taking not required
Feel free to take notes while you go through the documentation, and give us feedback on what you think is missing or could be added to the application documentation!

## Project Set-up and Housekeeping

Below are some quick guides to get you started. Feel free to read through them if you need, or skip them!

After this, we have a [Python Refresher](../02_python_refresher/index.md). If you are very comfortable with Python, feel free to skip that too!

If you're skipping the Python Refresher, move onto Your First REST API.

I'll see you there!
